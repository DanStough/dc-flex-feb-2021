1. As a user, I want to see a list of countries with their respective capitals and populations at the endpoint `/countries`.
2. As a user, I want to search for countries with a string of characters that returns only those countries that have the string in their name. For example, `/countries?name=aus` should return _Australia_, _Austria_. The search must be case insensitive.
3. As a user, I want to search for countries by the names of their respective capitals with a string of characters that returns only those countries whose capitals have the string in their name. For example, `/countries?capital=hel` should return _Finland_.
4. As a user, I want to search for countries whose populations are greater than some number and also less than some number. For example, `/countries?popmin=37&popmax=38` should return the data on all countries whose population falls between 37 million and 38 millionâ€“ Afghanistan, Canada, and Poland.
