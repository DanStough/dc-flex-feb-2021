Javascript data types:

String - is a sequence of text characters. 
Number - integers (whole numbers like 0, 42, 8675309) and floats (a number with a decimal point such as3.14159, 6.626068, 1.21)
Boolean - true or false
Arrays - a sequence of values ([1, 2, 3, 4], ["milk", "butter", "eggs"])
Objects - a sequence of labeled values ({ "name": "Galahad", "quest": "Seek the Grail", "favorite_color": "Blue"})

combine Strings by using the + operator

const creates a "permanent" label for a value
let
var- There is a third way to declare a variable using the keyword var. In earlier versions of JavaSript, it
was the only way to declare a variable. const and let were introduced as an improvement over some buggy behavior with var.

string interpolation -Example. console.log(`The answer is ${theAnswer}! Isn't that wonderful?`);
To use string interpolation you need two things:
A backtick-quoted string
A variable wrapped in ${}.

Operator	Meaning	Example	Result
+	Addition	1 + 1	2
-	Subtraction	3 - 2	1
*	Multiplication	2 * 3	6
/	Division	8 / 4	2
%	Remainder	3 % 2	1


What is a function?
A function is like a recipe. It requires certain ingredients. 
After all the steps are carried out, the result is a specific dish.

A function is defined in four parts
In JavaScript, you create a function by:

Using the function keyword
Naming the function
Declaring parameters ("ingredients")
Providing the body of the function as a code block


you run the function by using its name, followed by a pair of parentheses.

When you run a function, each statement in the function's body is run, in order.

Programmers refer to running a function as calling, executing, or invoking a function.
