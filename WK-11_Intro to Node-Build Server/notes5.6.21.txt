cowsay - https://www.npmjs.com/package/cowsay

 - mkdir 
 - cd into new directory
 - in terminal initialize npm -------npm init -y -------- (Means I want to initialize my project as npm library -y means accept all defaults(Optional))

 Now that it has been initialzed by NPM I can use other libraries written in NPM by other people. 

 - package.json is created (if you ever see package.json in code it means its npm)
        - Inside of package.json  -
        - name is defaulted to directory name
        - its key value pairs 
        - it can be changed   

 -  npm i cowsay ( the library we are using today)
 - ls (to see what came with it)
 - package-lock.json (helps keep track of the npm packages you are using. You never have to go in here)
 - node modules (code recieved from npm library cowsay )

- In terminal cowsay = require("cowsay");
- In terminal cowsay.say({text: 'I am a mooodule})
- You should get a code cow

***TIPS***
***when you choose libraries look for last published and weekly downloads***

example: webpack

                              Demo Building API
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

API - Exposes Methods or Data

You have to build a server in order to expose API data!

Build server with Express - https://www.npmjs.com/package/express

Steps

1. mkdir friendsAPI
2. cd friendsAPI
In terminal
3. npm init -y
4. npm install express
5. cat package.json (shows the dependencies created within package.json)
6. ls ( lists the new files created OPTIONAL)
7. npm install --sav-dev nodemon (auto restarts server)
8. cat package.json ( you will see (with flag -- saves as) dev dependencies and (without flag -- saves as) dependencies)
                **beneficial to know whats require to run the app and whats required to build the app**
9. copy text in express library 

            const express = require('express')
            const app = express()
            
            app.get('/', function (req, res) {
            res.send('Hello World')
            })
            
            app.listen(3000)

10. Create file server.js
11. paste code in server.js
12. package.json creazte start script
13. in terminal run script "npm run _______"(name of your script)
    ie. npm run start 

    ** make sure save and all other versions of vscode are closed **
