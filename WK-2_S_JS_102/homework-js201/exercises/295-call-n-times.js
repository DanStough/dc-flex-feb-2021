// Write a function "callNTimes" that takes two arguments: times (a number),
// and fn (a function). Execute the "fn" function "times" times.
//
// Remember the following about functions:
// > they can only be defined once (function definition)
// > they can be called 0 or more times (function invocation)
// > you can assign a function to a variable and pass it around just like any
//   other variable
//
// In this case, we assume that the person who is using "callNTimes" has defined
// their function, and is passing it into our function as an argument (ie:
// passing it around as a variable).
//
// Example:
// > callNTimes(5, hello)
// Hello, world!
// Hello, world!
// Hello, world!
// Hello, world!
// Hello, world!
//
// In this example we assume there is a function "hello" already defined and
// that it prints "Hello, world!" to the console.
