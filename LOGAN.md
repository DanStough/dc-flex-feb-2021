Hello! My name is Logan Sutter. I am 19 years old and my birthday is May 09 2001.
I am very interested in coding and flying airplanes. I have 70 hours logged in a
Cessna 172. I live in Tampa, Florida with my best friend Brad and my beautiful
fiance Monika. I hope this cohort will be fun, interesting, and most importantly,
productive.
