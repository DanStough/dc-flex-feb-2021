### In this lesson, you learned how to install and use Express to write an HTTP server. Using its .get() function, you registered handler functions for different route paths. Inside your handler functions, you used Express' res.send() to send the HTTP Response back to the browser, letting it set the HTTP Status Code and 'Content-Type' header automatically.

- You created a Node module with an Array of Objects and used module.exports to make that Array available in other JavaScript files. You used a for-of loop to iterate through your Array. Using route parameters, you created a single Express route that could handle any number of values.

- Using the Array's .find() method, you located a single item in the Array to .send() back in the HTTP Response, setting the .status() if no match was found.
