### Class Notes

1. **TODO List App Exercise**

Your job is to make a todo list add with the following features:

- Form input that accepts a task name, category (see the model below) and checkbox
    ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/a5efbd81-6676-4105-9ac9-8ded77e27bc1/Untitled.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/a5efbd81-6676-4105-9ac9-8ded77e27bc1/Untitled.png)
- A render function that takes the list of tasks and outputs a list
- Styling is optional (we'll be learning about better styling techniques on Thursday)
- Tips:
    - Use `map`, `map` is your friend for looping over items
    - Use template strings(backticks) to make your rendering easy
    - Don't forget to `preventDefault`
    - Turning form data into JavaScript Objects:

    ```jsx
    // `event` is the submit event
    // `event.target` is the html element that caused the event (i.e. the form)
    const formdata = new FormData(event.target);
    const entries = formdata.entries();
    const data = Object.fromEntries(entries);     // `data` is a JS object
    ```
