<h4>This ecercise is about making lists</h4>

<li> They're useful for displaying lists of stuff </li>
</ul>
That's about it

I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool
When you make a list, do it in this order:
<ol>
<li> Decide if it's an ordered list or not </li>
<li> If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag </li>
<li> Use li tags nested in the list for your list items </li>
<ul> 
    <li>Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other </li>
</ul>
</ol>
