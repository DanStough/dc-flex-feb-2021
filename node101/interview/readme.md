- Node.js? 
Node is an engine that runs JS on a server.
The creators of Node took the JavaScript engine from browsers and added functionality so you can create backend applications using the JavaScript language.

It has become one of the most popular web development tools in the world (used by millions and millions of projects) and comes with a package manager called npm, which we will cover in this lesson. Over the years, some amazing projects have been created, including Express and React, both of which you will learn in later lessons.
