## A Simple Business Site w/ React Router. 
The goal for this exercise is to demonstrate how to effectively turn a traditional website with many pages into a SPA (Single Page Application). 
Your goal is to create a website for you own fictional business.
1. Come up with a fun business, points for creativity
2. Create a new React application (where ever you like that's not already a git project)
3. Create a minimum of 5 Functional React Components using React Bootstrap
    1. Header  - Use the React Bootstrap header here (hint: also LINK tags>
    2. Home Page - Whatever you want. I picture and a heading will do
    3. Product Page - Use the React Bootstrap Card to feature 3 products.
    4. Contact Us - Include a picture and a "mailto" link.
    5. Footer - Anything goes. Minimum should be a copyright with the current year.
4. Create a website with three pages
    1. Each page has the SAME  header and footer component.
    2. Clicking on the links in the navigation should take you to a page hosting one of the 3 content components above.
    3. The browser should NOT fetch a new html page when you click on the navigation.
