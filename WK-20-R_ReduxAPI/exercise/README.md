* React-Redux

## Requirements
1. Start with the basic `create-react-template` and modify it to add [React-Redux and the toolkit](https://react-redux.js.org/tutorials/quick-start).
1. Create placeholder react components for your App, the GIF Search Form, and the Image display.
1. Sign up for a [GIHPY developer account](https://developers.giphy.com).
1. Use [RTK Query](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/tutorials/rtk-query) to make an API call to the [Search Endpoint](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/endpoint/#search). Use whatever keyword you would like for the search.

**Bonus points**: 
1. Figure out how to distribute your React app using static assets using an Express server.
2. Use Bootstrap of the CSS Framework of your choosing.
3. [Add images directly](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-images-fonts-and-files/) into your React application bundle.
