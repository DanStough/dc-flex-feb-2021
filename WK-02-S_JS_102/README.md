### Homework

1. [Complete the Retrospective](https://hackmd.io/OoWk-5x3Qh21pIff87AUOQ) for the first two weeks.
2. [Work on JS201 Exercises](https://github.com/DanStough/dc-flex-feb-2021/blob/ab557d14f9734b4344fc8a8e6c4f11d433f75982/WK-02-JS_102/homework-js201/README.md) (Minimum of 5)
    1. If you try using the test runner on Mac, and get an error like `No receipt for 'com.apple.pkg.CLTools_Executables' found at '/'.`, install the following using the terminal:
        1. `xcode-select --install`
3. Read [Solving Problems with Code](https://learn.digitalcrafts.com/flex/lessons/solving-problems-using-code-js/common-patterns/#learning-objectives) on the Learning Portal

5. Use the above sites to practice WHENEVER YOU GET FREE TIME and don't stop until the end of the class ðŸ˜‰

### Example Soln - 201-hello-world.js

```js
// Write a function "hello" that takes one argument (a name), and returns a
// string that says hello to the name.
// Examples:
// - hello('Mustache') should return 'Hello, Mustache!'
// - hello('banana') should return 'Hello, banana!'
// - hello('DETROIT') should return 'Hello, DETROIT!'

function hello(name) {
    return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}

// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
// Write a function "helloDefault" such that if no name is given it will return
// 'Hello, world!'
// Otherwise it behaves the same as the "hello" function.
function helloDefault(name) {
    if(name){
        // There is a name
        return hello(name);
    }
    else {
        // there is no name; name is undefined
        return hello("world");
    }
}
```
