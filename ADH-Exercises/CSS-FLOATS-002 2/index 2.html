      Stan Smith [picks up the phone]: This is Stan Smith. Principal Lewis: Mr.
      Smith, I'm afraid there's a problem with your son. Stan Smith: Oh, God,
      he's gay. This is it. This is the gay call. I've been ready for this for
      years. [starts chugging down pills] Principal Lewis: Uhh, no. It's just
      that he's gone mad with power. He evacuated the entire school and
      barricaded himself in my office. Stan Smith: I see. [foam starts coming
      out of his mouth] Stan Smith: Henry, antidote. [Stan is about to shoot
      Roger; Francine, Hayley and Steve stand in the way] Stan Smith: Nobody
      threatens my family! Now get out of the way or I'll shoot you all!
