            <h1>You can write your thoughts here</h1>
            <h2>Or rant about whatever grinds your gears</h2>
            <h3>Like that Jeremy guy, for example</h3>
            <h4>I mean, like what is his deal</h4>
            <h5>Why does he drink so much Coke Zero? Weird...</h5>

                <p>This exercise is about nesting div tags</p>
                    <div> 
                        <p>This div contains this text and the div tag below.</p>
                    </div>
                       <div>
                        <p>Hi, I'm the div tag that was mentioned in my parent div! I contain this text and two other children divs</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                        <p>Hi! Our parent was just talking about us. Please make sure you indent this example appropriately.</p>

            <div> 
                <p>This exercise is about making lists</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>This is what I like about lists:</p>
            </div>
            <h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff</li>
                    <li>That's about it</li>
                    <li>I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in three</li>
                </ul>
                <div>
                    <p>When you make a list, do it in this order:</p>
                </div>
                <h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
                        <li>If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Use li tags nested in the list for your list items</li>
                            </ul>
                                <ol>
                            <li>Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other</li> 
                                </ol>
                        <li>You've got this, I believe in you!</li>
                        <h1>4. Lines</h1>    
                        <h2>Lines. So many lines.</h2>
